(i) Create relations persons owns in sql
CREATE TABLE Person (
driver_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50),
address VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Car (
license VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
model VARCHAR(50),
year INT
);

CREATE TABLE Accident (
report_number INT PRIMARY KEY,
date DATE,
location VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Owns (
driver_id INT,
license VARCHAR(20),
FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES Person(driver_id),
FOREIGN KEY (license) REFERENCES Car(license),
PRIMARY KEY (driver_id, license)
);

CREATE TABLE Participated (
driver_id INT,
license VARCHAR(20),
report_number INT,
damage VARCHAR(100),
amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES Person(driver_id),
FOREIGN KEY (license) REFERENCES Car(license),
FOREIGN KEY (report_number) REFERENCES Accident(report_number),
PRIMARY KEY (driver_id, license, report_number)
);

(ii) Add a new accident to the database, assume any values for required
attribute.
INSERT INTO Accident (report_number, date, location) VALUES (12345, '2024-04-
28', 'City Center');


(iii) Delete the SKODA belonging to 'Sachin Parker'.
DELETE FROM Owns
WHERE driver_id = (SELECT driver_id FROM Person WHERE name = 'Sachin
Parker')
AND license IN (SELECT license FROM Car WHERE model = 'SKODA');


(iv) Find the total number of people who owned cars that were involved in
accident in 1999.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.driver_id) AS total_owners
FROM Person p
JOIN Owns o ON p.driver_id = o.driver_id
JOIN Participated pa ON o.license = pa.license
JOIN Accident a ON pa.report_number = a.report_number
WHERE YEAR(a.date) = 1999;


(v) Find the person whose names starts with 'S' and arrange in decreasing order
of driver-id.
SELECT *
FROM Person
WHERE name LIKE 'S%'
ORDER BY driver_id DESC;
